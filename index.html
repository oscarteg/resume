                  Chewpy is an solution for people that want to eat vegetarian
                  but don't know where to start. For that reason I helped the

                  developing the backend application and the REST API for the

                On my Github account, I make frequent use of “forking”
                repositories to save the repository for my own use. Updating a
                forked repository can be quite tedious so I wanted to make a CLI
                tool that automates this process. I have created a CLI tool in
                Go that uses the Graphql API of Github to create and accept pull
                request to update the repository with the latest commits of the
                original maintainer.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                This was the first time that I used Go to create a tool and that
                I used a Graphql API. With this, I wanted to learn about how to
                create a project in Go and how to use a Graphql API. There are
                still a lot of things that can improve.

                  I am always trying to improve my own productivity by changing
                  how I work and maintain my own life. For this purpose, I
                  wanted to create an application that I can easily use to
                  create boards with tasks to see what I have to do. I could
                  have used Trello but I wanted to create something for myself.
                  In the future also wanted to integrate it with Toggle and
                  Google Calendar for a better overview. The technologies I used
